# Connect4Chess

## Overview
In this game Connect 4 is played against chess. The chess player will try to stop the connect 4 player from making a 4 in-a-row.  
To make it a bit more fair, the chess player gets the first 3 moves and the Connect 4 player is limited to 15 tokens.  
The chess player wins if the opponent runs out of tokens.
